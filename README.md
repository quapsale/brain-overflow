# BrainOverflow 🚧

Welcome to **BrainOverflow** – a work-in-progress open-source repository for free and accessible Computer Science courses, written by Pasquale De Rosa (CS PhD @UniNE, Switzerland).
This project is built on my personal and professional experience as a researcher and educator in the fields of Computer Systems and Machine Learning.
I'm just getting started, but my goal is to build a small hub of quality resources for learners of all levels.

## 🚀 Vision
BrainOverflow aims to:
- Provide free, crash CS courses.
- Encourage hands-on learning through projects.

## 🏗️ What's Here So Far
As I'm still building, here's a glimpse of what you can expect (and what's currently in the works):
- **[WIP] Introduction to Computer Programming**: Master the fundamentals of computer programming in C, C++, and Java.
- **[WIP] Compilers**: Learn about compilers, and how to engineer a compiler using lex and yacc.
- **[WIP] Machine Learning**: Explore the fundamentals of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Python.

Additional topics might include:
- **Probability Theory**
- **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**
    
Stay tuned – I will add new topics and materials regularly!

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository is currently a work-in-progress. Expect incomplete materials, rough edges, and lots of updates as I build out the content.
