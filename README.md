# BrainOverflow 🚧

Welcome to **BrainOverflow** – a work-in-progress open-source repository for free and accessible Computer Science courses, written by Pasquale De Rosa (CS PhD @UniNE, Switzerland).
This project is built on my personal and professional experience as a researcher and educator in the fields of Computer Systems and Machine Learning.
I'm just getting started, but my goal is to build a small hub of quality resources for learners of all levels.

## 🚀 Vision
BrainOverflow aims to:
- Provide free, crash CS courses.
- Encourage hands-on learning through projects.

## 🏗️ What's Here So Far
As I'm still building, here's a glimpse of what you might expect (and what's currently in the works):

### Programming:
- **[WIP] Computer Programming I**: master the fundamentals of procedural programming in C.
- **[WIP] Computer Programming II**: understand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in C++.

### Systems:
- **[WIP] Compilers**: learn about compilers, and how to engineer a compiler using lex and yacc.
- **[TBD] Computer Networks**: study the principles of computer networking, including protocols, data transmission and security.

### ML:
- **[TBD] Machine Learning I**: explore the fundamentals of Machine Learning with applications in Python and R.
- **[TBD] Machine Learning II**: delve into Deep Learning model design with PyTorch.

### Math:
- **[TBD] Probability**: learn random variables, probability distributions and stochastic processes with applications in R.
- **[TBD] Time Series Analysis**: analyze and model time-dependent data using R.

Stay tuned – I will add new topics and materials regularly!
